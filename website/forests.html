        Forests are large areas of land covered by trees
        <img src="IMG-20210816-WA0045.jpg"> 

Forests cover around 4 billion hectares or 30% of the Earth's land surface.

There are over 60000 known tree species on earth 

half of the forests that originally covered 48% of the Earth's land surface are gone due to the increase in the need for 
wood fuel, timber and space for expansion in the past 2 centuries. 

70% of the worlds animals depend on forests for their homes

forests create beautiful scenaries for photographers all over the world and are sources of an unthinkable amount of resources
