The ocean is the body of salt that covers about 70%of the earth's surface and contains 97% of the earth's water

the ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere and therefore responsible for life in earth

ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases  like oxygen, carbon dioxide and even nitrogen

Its unkown how many different species call the ocean home

The ocean is currently known to be a habitat of about 230000 species but it may contain far more. it could be that 90% 
of the ocean's species are still undiscovered.

but with many ecosystems suffering from rising sea temperatures, pollution and other problems, some oceanographers 
believe the number of species is dropping

humans know more about outer space than the oceans on our own planet
New species are being discovered deep inside the oceans every year
