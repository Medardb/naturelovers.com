strong thunderstorms(supercells) can produce strong winds, heavy rain, flooding hail and tornadoes

It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong winds, tornadoes, hail, thunder,
and lightning, heavy precipitation, freezing rain or wind transporting some substance such as dust in a sandstorm

wildfires or wind shear

heavy snowfall can cause special recreational activities to take place which would not be possible otherwise like skiing
