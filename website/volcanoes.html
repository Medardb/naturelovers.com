Volcanoes are earth's geologic architects and have created more than 80% of the earth's surface laying the foundation for life on earth to thrive.
their explosive nature creates mountais, craters  even lava rivers that flow downhill from the source of the eruption.

There are volcanoes on every continent, even Antarctica
Each volcano is different. 
Some burst to life in powerful eruptions and explosions of lava
